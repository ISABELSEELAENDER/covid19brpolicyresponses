# CGRT-BRFED USP Data Repository

The COVID-19 Government Response Tracker for the Brazilian Federation(CGRT-BRFED) database has the general goal of following, the measures adopted in real-time by the Federal Government, and by each Brazilan Federation state to confront the pandemic of coronavirus. Moreover, the database counts with the codification of nine capitals - São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Manaus, Recife, Fortaleza, Salvador, Porto Alegre, and Goiânia.

The methodology adopted is inspired in the database developed by Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) at Blavatnik School of Government observatory, in which the objective is to track the prevention measures and the reactions from national governments to the spread of the virus.
Primary data are only extracted from official sources (only states and capitals official press are considered), to guarantee information precision. The objective is to capture the measures that were enacted or established by state or subnational government ministerial orders, or laws that were approved by the respective legislative chamber in each federation unit.  Similarly, the capitals’ dataset is based on the same criteria.
